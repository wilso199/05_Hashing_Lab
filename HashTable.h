/*
 * Note: Just above your template declaration when you use this class, you
 * must define method called "hash" that takes a Key as input, and returns
 * an unsigned long (which is the hash value)
 *
 * For example, you might do:
 * unsigned long hash(char c){ return 10*((unsigned long)c)%13; }
 * HashTable<char,int> mySillyTable;
 *
 * If you don't define an appropriate hash function, the class won't compile.
